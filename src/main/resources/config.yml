# ${project.artifactId}, version ${project.version} -  Configuration file.

# You can specify per-worlds value like that:
# .
# trident-despawn-rates:
#   default: 100        # "default" is applied to all worlds without a specific value
#   world: 18000        # this is for the world called "world"
#   world_nether: 500   # for the nether of world "world" (the default nether)
#   world_the_end: 3000 # same the default end
# .
# Keys are world names and values server "ticks" (20 ticks is about 1 second). It's the delay before a thrown trident,
# planted in a block will despawn. Otherwise, it will use the same value than arrows (default: 1200 ticks = 1 minute),
# which is very short for a rare item... (could be worse if you had reduced the value as Optimization guide recommend).
# So, this plugin allows you to customize this delay to let you optimize arrows despawn without impacting tridents.
# .
# Note:
# 1. Trident NOT THROWN but droped on the ground will not use this value, but the item despawn rate instead.
#    ("world-settings.<world>.item-despawn-rate" in your spigot.yml file.)
# .
# 2. If a value is lower than the corresponding "world-settings.<world>.arrow-despawn-rate" from your spigot.yml,
#    it will be ignored, so you can define a very lower value for arrows into it (I personnaly use 200),
#    and increase the despawn rate for tridents here.
